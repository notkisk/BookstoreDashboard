🛠️ Full Feature Request & Bug Fix Prompt for Bookstore Web App
✅ 1. Use Existing Location Data Tab for Delivery Fees
In the existing Location Data tab (which already includes Wilaya numbers and Communes), add:

A column for Desk Delivery Price

A column for Doorstep Delivery Price

These inputs should be editable manually.

When placing an order:

If I choose the Wilaya, Commune, and check/uncheck the "Stop Desk" box:

The Delivery Fee field in the order form should be automatically filled using the data from the Location Data tab.

✅ 2. Order Filtering & Auto-Calculation
Add filter in the Orders Tab to filter orders by Wilaya.

Recalculate and update the profit equation (consider book prices, delivery fee, and cost if applicable).

In the Dashboard, stats should be interactive:

The % changes (e.g., "18% increase") should be auto-calculated based on previous data periods.

✅ 3. Book Inventory Logic Enhancement
Add a new column in the Book Inventory Tab:

📌 "Delivering Quantity" – shows how many copies of the book are currently being delivered (not delivered yet).

This column is updated as follows:

When order status changes from Pending → Delivering:

Decrease the Stock

Increase the Delivering Quantity

When order status changes from Delivering → Delivered:

Decrease the Delivering Quantity

Increase the Sold count

When order status changes from Delivering → Reactionary (مرتجع):

Decrease Delivering Quantity

Increase Stock

📌 This logic must rely on the actual ordered books quantity per order.

✅ 4. Order Status & Dashboard Fixes
Fix the bug where changing order status gives this error:
"Failed to update order status. Please try again."

In the Dashboard, improve the order display:

Show full Order Details:

Books ordered

Total order value

Wilaya

Delivery type (Desk / Doorstep)

Customer Name (currently showing as "Unknown", should be fixed and linked to stored customer data)

Add a way to change order status directly from Dashboard to:

Pending → Delivering

Delivering → Delivered

Delivering → Reactionary

✅ 5. Dashboard Stats & Visuals
On the Dashboard, add:

A graph showing the number of orders per Wilaya over a given time period

Count of all orders by status:

Pending

Delivering

Delivered

Reactionary

The best-selling book by order volume
