Build me a full-stack dashboard web app to manage my online bookstore. I currently manage my data using an Excel sheet that includes book inventory, customer info, and orders. I want a modern and efficient dashboard where I can:

✅ CSV Import & Smart Data Mapping
Upload a .csv file (Excel format) containing book data

Manually map columns (e.g., Column A = title, Column B = price)

Automatically parse, validate, and display books in a styled interactive table

📚 Book Inventory
List all books with details: title, price, quantity bought, quantity left, author, publisher, and buy price

Include filters, sort, and fuzzy search (e.g., via Fuse.js)

Quantity bought & quantity left used to track stock and sales

🛒 Order Creation (Facebook Orders)
Input form for new orders:

Customer info: name*, phone*, phone2 (optional), full address*, wilaya*, commune*, delivery type*

Dropdowns with fuzzy search for:

All 58 Algerian wilayas (numbered 01–58)

Dynamic communes list per wilaya

Books in order: select books, default quantity = 1, allow adjustments

Order total auto-calculated

Checkbox options for:

Fragile

Echange

Pick up

Recouvrement

Stop Desk ✅ (mandatory checkbox)

Auto-fill customer info when phone/name already exists (saved in DB)

Save all orders and customer data to DB

📤 Export Orders (Delivery CSV)
Export order data to CSV in the following format and order:

reference commande

nom et prenom du destinataire*

telephone*

telephone 2

code wilaya* (auto from wilaya selection)

wilaya de livraison

commune de livraison*

adresse de livraison*

produit* = "livres" (default)

poids (kg) (optional, leave empty)

montant du colis*

remarque

FRAGILE, ECHANGE, PICK UP, RECOUVREMENT, STOP DESK, Lien map

Only starred fields are required when filling orders

📊 Dashboard Analytics
Show:

Orders count per day/week/month

Total sales

Profit (based on buy price vs sale price)

Filter by date range

🎨 Design & Tech
Modern responsive UI using ShadCN UI components

Use Tailwind CSS with main color: #e4d1b3

Clean, elegant layout with side nav, cards, and tables

Stack: React + Node.js (or Flask) + PostgreSQL or SQLite

Optional: use Prisma ORM or Sequelize if Node.js

🧠 Prioritize fast order filling, smart search, clean UI, and export accuracy.
🛠️ Feel free to be creative — make this feel like a high-end internal tool.
